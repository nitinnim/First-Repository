              “This will enhance and reinforce the perception about India as a
              multifaceted destination," she said. The new global campaign will
              also feature several examples of foreign tourists who decided to
              stay back here. “The campaign aims to go beyond the tourist sites
              and destinations in the country. Whether one is looking for beauty
              of the nature or spiritual fulfillment or for that matter
              luxurious holiday, the search ends here and this is the message we
              want to convey through our new campaign," she said.

              The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning
              out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater
              development. While all the attention is on social-political
              issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms.
              Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment,
              waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for
              a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say
              it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat
              only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
